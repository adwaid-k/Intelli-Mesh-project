# Intelli-Mesh-project
Intelli-Mesh is a robust, open-source mesh network with multi-WAN support. Built on a custom OpenWRT Linux for Banana Pi, it uses BATMAN-ADV for dynamic routing, load balancing, and self-healing for uninterrupted connectivity. A Python Flask and JavaScript dashboard enables real-time monitoring and control, ideal for resilient network setups.
